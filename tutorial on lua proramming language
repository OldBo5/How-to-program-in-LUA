-- This is a comment.
print("This is a print statement.")
local whatever = "!" -- This is a variable.
local function Print() -- This is a function we use to make our own functions.
print("Hello, world!")
end -- This will end your statement.
-- Now, if we want to make a loop, we can do this by doing the following below \/
while true do
wait(1) -- This will wait 1 second until repeating our print hello world.
print("Hello, world!")
wait(5)
break -- What this does is it breaks out of our loop.
end
-- I will update this sometimes so stay toon!
